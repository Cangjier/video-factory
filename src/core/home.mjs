/**
 * The shared plugin home: one directory for the static dependencies every plugin in this family
 * borrows.
 *
 * Six plugins used to keep six `vendor/` directories, and the same 200 MB ffmpeg build was reachable
 * from all of them by a chain of `../<sibling>/vendor/...` guesses. That worked only while the
 * checkouts sat side by side; a machine that installed one plugin on its own, or moved a checkout,
 * lost a binary that was already on the disk. The layout below replaces the guess with one named
 * place:
 *
 * ```
 * ~/.dsh-plugins/
 *   ffmpeg/bin/            ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe, ffplay.exe (dsh-ffmpeg owns the install)
 *   ocr/<source>/          the offline OCR engine, with its 7zr.exe under tools/ (dsh-ocr)
 *   models/yamnet/         YAMNet ONNX + class map (dsh-video-audio)
 *   models/u2netp/         the matting model (video-factory)
 *   lib/onnxruntime-web/   the ONNX WASM runtime, shared by matting and audio events
 * ```
 *
 * **Resolution is not an env var.** The root is derived from **the home directory** — one per user,
 * so two users on one machine cannot see or overwrite each other's 200 MB, and a machine that moves
 * keeps working. `DSH_PLUGIN_HOME` overrides it for the machine whose home directory is not where
 * the assets should go.
 *
 * Each plugin reads this directory and falls back to the layouts that existed before it (its own
 * `vendor/`, then a sibling checkout's), so a machine that installed a build earlier keeps working
 * without re-downloading. Nothing here writes anything; the installers own that, and every state
 * report names which rule answered.
 *
 * This module is deliberately self-contained and duplicated verbatim in each plugin: the six are
 * independent packages, and a plugin installed on its own must not need a checkout of the others to
 * find its own binaries.
 *
 * @module video-factory/core/home
