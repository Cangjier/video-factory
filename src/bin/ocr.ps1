# OCR a PNG file and print the recognised lines as JSON.
#
# Windows ships an OCR engine, but it is only reachable through WinRT, which PowerShell 5.1
# cannot await directly. This wraps that up so the rest of the system can treat OCR as an
# ordinary command.
#
# Why this exists rather than "the agent looks at the screenshot": OCR returns text WITH pixel
# coordinates in about 140 ms for a full screen. That makes it usable inside an automation loop
# — find a label, click where the label is — whereas asking a model to read every frame costs
# seconds per step.
#
# Accuracy note, measured on a real screen: Chinese labels on a document page came out
# correctly, but small mixed-script text degraded (`TypeScript` was read as `TvoeScriDt`).
# Treat the text as a locator and a hint, not as ground truth for data extraction.
#
# Usage:
#   ocr.ps1 -Path shot.png [-Language zh-Hans-CN] [-Region x,y,w,h] [-Scale 3]
#
# Output: JSON { language, lineCount, elapsedMs, lines: [ { text, x, y, width, height } ] }
