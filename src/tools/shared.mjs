/**
 * Shared helpers for building the model-facing `video_*` tool definitions.
 *
 * Three rules shape everything here:
 *
 * 1. **The JSON Schema of every tool enters the model context on every turn.** So the
 *    surface is grouped by job stage with an `action` dispatcher rather than spread across
 *    dozens of flat tools, and no sentence is written twice inside one schema.
 *
 * 2. **The prose lives in exactly one place.** `registry.mjs` holds what each action does,
 *    when to use it, what it requires and what it costs; this module derives the tool
 *    description and the `action` enum description from it, so the two can never disagree
 *    and the model is never charged twice for the same sentence. The long tail — return
 *    shapes, pitfalls, examples, neighbouring actions — is fetched on demand through
 *    `video_guide` instead of being resident.
 *
 * 3. **A tool is a deterministic operation, never a pipeline.** Anything that encodes a
 *    creative choice (which scenes to use, how long they run, what order they go in)
 *    belongs to DSH, not to this plugin.
 *
 * @module video-factory/tools/shared
